# Turning Things Around for a University Mate: The Story Behind AbdulBasitPawar.com

## The Story

[See the final project live here](https://www.abdulbasitpawar.com/)

This project holds a special place for me.

Originally, it was given to another developer, but unfortunately, the work didn’t turn out the way it should have. When the client — who also happens to be an old acquaintance from my university days — reached out to me disappointed, I knew I had to step in.

I took charge of the situation immediately. That very night, I sat down, put my head into the project, and stayed up late until I had everything working just the way he wanted. No shortcuts, no excuses — just pure focus until the job was done right.

The end result? He was genuinely thrilled — and you can see the outcome for yourself [here](https://www.abdulbasitpawar.com/).

What makes this even more special is our shared history. During my time at his university, I used to rent bikes from his startup, **BikeChahye** — a much-needed service for students like me when Uber was the only other option on campus. Helping him build his online platform now felt like a small way of paying it forward.

It’s projects like these that remind me why I love what I do.

**P.S.:** 

On a side note, I got the opportunity to improve my design skills as well. I'm more of a full-stack developer, with design not really being 'my thing', but hey, it never hurts to try out new stuff!

Here are some screenshots from what I built:

## Developing

In case you want to use this template, please feel free to do so.

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
